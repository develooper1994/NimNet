# NimNet
A tiny deep learning framework, written in pure Nim, based on nnfs.io

## NOTICE
I want to learn both machine learning and the math behind it all from the ground up. I don't recommend anyone using this library for production anytime in the near future. I'll be improving and adding to the library as I move through the NNFS guide [https:nnfs.io](here) and become a better Nim developer.

The math (common.nim) is not optimized at all right now- there are no iterators, inline functions, etc to improve efficiency or exception handling.

That being said...

The concept of a deep learning framework written in pure Nim still sounds pretty cool
