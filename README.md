# NimNet
Deep learning framework based on https://nnfs.io. Written in pure Nim, no 3rd party libraries or dependencies.

## About
This is a project I'm taking on to learn both deep learning and the math behind it all from the ground up. I'll be improving and adding to the library as I move through the NNFS guide [here](https://nnfs.io) and become a better Nim developer.

The math (common.nim) is not optimized at all right now- there are no iterators, inline functions, etc to improve efficiency or exception handling.

That being said...

The concept of a deep learning framework written in pure Nim still sounds pretty cool
