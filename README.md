# NimNet
A Deep Learning framework written in pure Nim, standard lib only. No dependencies. Based on https://nnfs.io

## About
This is a project I'm taking on to learn both Deep Learning and the math behind it all- from the ground up. I'll be improving and adding to the library as I move through the [NNFS guide](https://nnfs.io) and become a better Nim developer.

The math lib (common.nim) is not optimized at all right now- there are no iterators, inline functions, etc to improve efficiency or exception handling.

That being said...

The concept of a deep learning framework written in pure Nim still sounds pretty damn cool and I intend on seeing it through
